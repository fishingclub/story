                I’m not sure what to call this, my online writings, my blog, my way of trying to explain my fucked up world view in a way that is coherent to the rest of the word, but honestly I’m not sure how this will land.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I was younger I had dreamed that I would do something great with my life. When I was in kindergarten I wanted to be a painter, when I was in high school I wore a NASA shirt every day, and when in college I realized I wasn’t all that smart. I switched majors a few times, first physics, then engineering, then accounting. I knew it was a boring field but at least it was reliable and pays decently well. I studied pretty hard, got my degree and CPA license, and got my first job at some shady home insurance firm, and fifteen years later I’m still here. I’ve gotten a few small raises but never any real promotions, my student loans still aren’t paid off, I don’t own a house, lord knows I could never come up with a down payment.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s almost like I’m a hamster running in its little hamster wheel, working hard at my bull-shit-ass-job sitting at a bull-shit-ass computer looking at bull-shit-ass-numbers all day for the privilege of getting enough money to survive until the next day, and everytime I get some money saved up, or I have at least something nice in my life going on for once, some bull-shit-ass-event kills my entire savings account. Once I almost saved enough money to buy a small townhouse, until some dick felt the need to steal my car and wreck it in a chase, and of course the insurance that my shady employer recommended didn’t pay anything. Shocker. Then after I bought a new car and started to bounce back a little, someone decided to hit me with their car and my shady health insurance from my shady employer left me on the hook for a hospital bill with six digits on it, who would have thought it. Everytime I roll the boulder up the hill, someone or something kicks it down to the bottom, and I’m so beyond done with it.

                It’s me again. I’m sorry if I came off as a bit bitchy in my first post but I just had a lot on my mind going on at the moment. It’s all still in my mind but atleast I’m in a slightly better mood about it. Yesterday during my lunch break my boss started bitching about my numbers and how the budget won’t work out and all types of shit that is not in my pay grade, like I’m sorry I can’t just pull money out my ass and put it in the budget but one way or another the companies broke. God I’m going to strangle that guy one day.

                I had a great day today (see I don’t only just complain). I had a good day at work. I got alot done. I got paid today as well. The best part is, on my way home my car decided to just kill itself. There goes another 3 grand cause fuck me I guess. Why was I even put on this Earth, just to have to deal with this shit every time something decent happens to me. Sometimes I wish I wasn’t here, and maybe then I would be able to rest for once.

                Genuinely why do I even do anything. Everytime my life starts to go in a positive direction, some kind of insane event details any progress that happens. Nothing even happened since my last post. My car is still getting fixed and I’ve had way too much time to think to myself. Why do I put myself through any of this bs. Nothing really has a purpose and all the hardship I put myself through can’t and won’t amount to anything worthwhile. Like lets say my life goes perfectly and I get a lot of money, now what. I could get a big house and a fast car, but so what, none of that shit matters anyways. Maybe I can put the kids my parents are pressuring me to get in them but why should I even have a family. I hate kids and I cant imagine I would be good at taking care of them anyways. I feel like I’m a few beers away from being a a shitty victorian age philosopher that preaches that life has no meaning before jumping off the top of a church.

                Sorry for not posting here in a while. Honestly I haven’t been busy at all, I just couldn’t be asked to write about anything. I was listening to the radio the other day and the host randomly went on a rant on how the meaning of life isn’t something given to you, its something you take. I’m not 100 percent sure what that means but I think its a sign that I should get a hobby. Maybe I should go backpacking through Thailand or Mongolia to find myself like one of those trust fund white girls after college.

                I started drawing after my last post. I still haven’t found the meaning of life. I also remembered that I sucked at drawing so don’t expect me to post any of my masterpieces any soon. I think Ima buy some of those really expensive pencils and shit from Michaels.

                Ok this is probably gonna be my last post on this page. I pretty much made this page just to complain about my life and the world around me but I don’t really feel the need to anymore. To be honest my life hasn’t really gotten any better from a subjective standpoint, my job still sucks and Im still broke but honestly it doesn’t feel as bad. I don’t know how to describe it. I kind of just accepted it over the past month or so its kind of weird. In my last few posts I talked about finding meaning in life like im an ancient greek philosopher but honestly I think I’ve accepted the fact that in the grand scheme of things, there is no “true” meaning of life and I should just do what ever I wish. Its kind of funny, Im a grown ass man and I forget that I can just do whatever I what in a way.

                	This story was unique. The short story was very much inspired by the myth of Sisyphus, more specifically, Sisyphus's punishment of pushing a rock up a hill for eternity, and Albert Camus’s philosophical idea of absurdism as written in his book The Myth of Sisyphus. Absurdism introduces the idea that life is "absurd" and inherently meaningless, and attempting to find meaning in any of it will only result in conflict and frustration; instead, individuals should not only accept this truth, but fight the absurd with every fiber of their body. Camus believes one should not roll over to the absurd, but instead revolt against it, saying, "There is no fate that can not be surmounted by scorn". Using the myth of Sisyphus as a kind of allegory for his idea, he says Sisyphus pushing the stone purely to spite the gods is what gives his life meaning. Albert Camus believes despite the bleak and miserable situation that the former king was in, "One must imagine Sisyphus happy."

                	I got the idea of using a diary-like format from the book Go Ask Alice, but I originally wanted to film a series of video diary entries of me talking to a camera in my car before I realized that would be very annoying and even more time-consuming, so instead I had Google's Gemini Ai to make an HTML template for an online diary which I can use for the story. At first, I was going to write the code myself, but I quickly remembered that I failed my computer science class twice and can't code for my life. I also got the image of the dog from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tahltan_bear_dog_sketch.jpg" target="_blank">here(click)</a>
